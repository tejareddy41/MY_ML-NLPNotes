"Now letâ€™s take a look at our demo webpage to see Link Guardian in action."

"On this sample page, weâ€™ve placed a few hyperlinks â€” one working, and a couple intentionally broken. These simulate real-world scenarios like outdated Confluence links, retired Jira tickets, or deprecated storage references that we often come across in enterprise environments."

"With just one click on our 'Scan for Broken Links' button, our JavaScript utility instantly highlights all dead or unreachable links on the page. It also generates a downloadable report for offline reference or audit trails."


---

"Why is this important?"

"Because broken links â€” while small â€” can cause significant delays. They mislead teams, damage trust in internal documentation, and even create compliance issues if sensitive information or regulatory references are lost or outdated."

"For example, a compliance team referring to an outdated retention policy or an employee using an expired onboarding checklist can cause reputational, legal, and operational risk."


---

"Now imagine this tool not just as a local webpage utility, but scaled as a browser extension â€” silently working in the background. It could notify content authors in real-time when they visit or edit a Confluence, SharePoint, or wiki page that contains broken links."

"Even better, we can schedule this as a monthly batch job across a set of company-managed URLs. For example, running it across all engineering or HR Confluence spaces every month and sending auto-notifications to owners for broken or non-compliant links."

"This would eliminate outdated documentation debt before it grows, ensure smoother handovers, and drastically improve knowledge management hygiene."

> (Pause to highlight chatbot if included)



"To complement this, weâ€™ve integrated a chatbot that understands the page content and can assist users with questions like â€˜What is this page about?â€™ â€” making documentation more interactive and user-friendly."


---

"In summary, this demo shows how a simple idea â€” broken link detection â€” can evolve into a powerful organizational hygiene tool that saves time, improves accuracy, and supports compliance across teams."
